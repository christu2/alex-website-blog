          <p>Hi, I'm Alex—a fellow traveler on the path of self-discovery and healing. I know the power of coming home to your body and presence—where true healing begins.</p>
          
          <p>For years, my life appeared "successful" on the outside: I worked as a marketing manager at a Fortune 500 company, hit targets, and climbed the corporate ladder. But deep within, something was missing. I craved a life of true alignment—one that awakened my inner vitality and empowered me to create my own path.</p>
          
          <p>So, I listened to my intuition. I followed it all the way to Ikaria, Greece—an island known for its slow rhythms and longevity. There, I immersed myself in profound inner work, reconnecting with my body, breath, and the essence of who I truly am.</p>
          
          <p>Now, based in the lush nature of Costa Rica, I've created a life that aligns with my heart. I'm here to hold space for others as they rediscover alignment and healing in their lives.</p>
          
          <p><strong>You have the Power to create a thriving Life—Mind, Body, and Spirit.</strong></p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is the Fascia and Block Therapy™?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">The fascia is the connective tissue that surrounds every structure in the body. Fascia acts as a communication system for our trillions of cells, holding us upright with stability while allowing fluidity and flexibility.<br><br>Block Therapy™ is a powerful system that helps you tap into your body's innate wisdom by releasing adhesions in your fascia. It combines therapy, exercise, and meditation, guiding you to reconnect with your body in a way that nurtures and supports your well-being.<br><br>This practice is about more than just physical health; it's about restoring the natural flow of energy and life force within you.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why Should I Care About the Health of my Fascia?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Due to gravity, unconscious posture, breathing patterns, injuries, and daily habits—the fascia becomes gripped, leading to adhesions. These adhesions, lack of flow, and improper breathing are at the root of many physical, mental, and emotional challenges.<br><br>By working with your fascia, you can release built-up tension, stored emotions, and even chronic pain, creating space for healing and vitality. Releasing these adhesions restores balance, improves overall health, and allows energy to flow freely.<br><br>Above all, this work teaches you how to become your own health advocate—empowering you to listen to your body, honor its signals, and move forward with confidence and clarity. It's not about trying to force anything—it's about clearing the space within so you can align your mind, body, and spirit for holistic well-being.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Conditions Affected by Fascia Health</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Fascia is at the core of many physical, mental, and emotional ailments. Conditions like:<br><br>Alzheimer's, Endometriosis, SIBO, Leaky Gut, Asthma, Allergies, Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, Fatty Liver Disease, Chronic Inflammation, Infertility, Scoliosis, Diabetes, Autoimmunity, Thyroid Disease, Hormone Imbalance, Fibromyalgia, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, Dementia. It all comes back to fascia adhesions, congestion, and lack of flow.</div>
